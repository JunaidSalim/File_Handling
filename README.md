# File-Handling
This C++ program reads polynomial data from a file, performs coefficient addition, and outputs the result with additional information.

Polynomial Coefficient Addition Program
Developed by Junaid Saleem

Introduction:
This is a C++ program that performs addition on polynomial coefficients read from a file. It calculates the total time taken for the addition operation, counts the number of non-zero values, and writes the result to an output file. The program utilizes arrays as the data structure and provides an option to display the data from the input file.

Instructions:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the C++ source code using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable to start the program.
4. Enter the name of the input file in the format (file_name.txt) when prompted.
5. The program will read the polynomial data from the file, perform coefficient addition, and generate an output file with the results.
6. If desired, choose to display the polynomial data on the console.
7. The program will calculate the total time taken for the addition operation and provide additional information such as the number of non-zero values.
8. The output file will contain the file name, number of polynomials, number of variables, data structure used (array), total time taken for addition, coefficients, and the polynomial expression.
9. Review the output file for the results of the polynomial coefficient addition.
10. Explore the code for further understanding and customization.

Note: Ensure that the input file is in the correct format and contains the appropriate polynomial data.

Enjoy using the Polynomial Coefficient Addition Program and leverage its functionality to perform efficient coefficient calculations on polynomials!
